#A diagnostic test has a 98% probability of giving a positive result when applied to a person suffering from Thripshaw's Disease, 
#and 10% probability of giving a (false) positive when applied to a non-sufferer. It is estimated that 0.5 % of the population are 
#sufferers. Suppose that the test is now administered to a person whose disease status is unknown. Calculate the probability that the
#test will:

#Be positive
#Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw's
#Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw's
#Misclassify the person

P(Accuracy) = 98%
P(FalsePositive) = 10%
P(Disease) = .5%

# 1. 98%*.5%+10%*99.5% = .49%+9.55% = 10.04%
# 2. 98%
# 3. 98% - 10%
# 4. 98%*.5%+10%*.5%
